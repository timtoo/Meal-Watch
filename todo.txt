- redirect someplace more sane after entering eaten meal
- somewhere display data summary: oldest record, newest, number of
  records, etc.

- single meal display page
    - meal details
    - log of eaten

- update average ratings on rating insert
- constrain to "dinner" mealtype? (ie support breakfast, lunch, etc)
- individual record display in popup?

- create new user account.
    - add default data on creation (food types, etc)

- finer grained permissions than just logged in?

- display colour in food creation/edit
    - colour picker?
- do some validation on colour field?

- if meal has attached eaten instance do not allow delete.
    - later I'd like to display a summary of eaten meals before allowing
      delete

- HTML being escaped in notifications (eg. edit beans & weiners)
- make sure quote marks are escaped when inserting text into javascript
  (is there safe javascript filter?) (where is this a problem?)
